Associative
Elements in associative containers are referenced by their key and not by their absolute position in the container.
Ordered
The elements in the container follow a strict order at all times. All inserted elements are given a position in this order.
Map
Each element associates a key to a mapped value: Keys are meant to identify the elements whose main content is the mapped value.
Unique keys
No two elements in the container can have equivalent keys.
Allocator-aware
The container uses an allocator object to dynamically handle its storage needs.
